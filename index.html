  <h1>Fragments.js</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>So what's <code>fragments.js</code>? Is it yet another library? Is it a
  methodology? No, and no, it is more like a philosophy. The main idea behind
  <code>fragments.js</code> is to use the tools at hand to their maximum.
  Libraries are good, and even necessary in some situations, but they also
  carry a cost. They need be activily maintained and upgrades sometime require
  you to change your code. You could perhaps call <code>fragments.js</code>
  design patterns but I prefer to see it more like a learning process.</p>

  <p>The artilces below outlines solutions to common needs when developing
  web apps. The idea is that you copy the snippets you need. It does take a
  little more effort but it will be cheaper, and more fun, in the long run.
  <i>And it will make you a better developer.</i></p>

  <p>Where is the download button? Well, there is none! Check out the solution
  for your need and <i>view source</i> and copy/paste what you need
  .</p>

  <h2>Note</h2>

  This site currently has a very modest (or zero) design. Hang in there, I
  currently prioritize content over design, perhaps I'll fix the design also
  sometime.

  <h2>License</h2>
