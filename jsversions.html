<h1>Browser and JavaScript engines and versions</h1>

<p>There are many browsers but there is only a handset of rendering engines and
these are the base for all browsers. This is of course good to keep in mind
when testing for browser compability.</p>

<p>These are the main rendering engines used today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blink redering engine - Chrome and Opera (a fork of webKit)</li>
  <li>webKit rendering engine - Safari, Safari Mobile and Android</li>
  <li>Gecko - Firefox</li>
  <li>Trident - Internet Explorer</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are the JavaScript engines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>V8 JavaScript engine - Chrome, Opera (also used by NodeJS, server-side
  JavaScript)</li>
  <li>JavaScriptCore (based on KJS) - Safari</li>
  <li>Spidermonkey - Firefox</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript (EcmaScript) versions</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a modern programming language that was misunderstood for many
years. <a href='crockford.com'>Douglas Crockford</a> wrote the article
<a href='http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html'>JavaScript:
The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language
</a> in 2011 reasoning around why he thinks this has been the case. The official
name for JavaScript is actually EcmaScript, often abbreviated ES.</p>

<p>EcmaScript 5.1 (ES5) was a main update that was released in 2011 that enhanced
JavsScript in many ways. I'm using the added <code>Array</code> functions all
the time and getters/setters are used in the data binding implementation.
<code>Object.create</code> is used easily implement proper inheritance and
<code>Object.keys</code> makes it possible to list the properties of an object.
</p>

<p>It is safe to use most ES5 features if you're not concerned with
old browers like IE6/7/8. The combined market share for IE6/7/8 varies from time
to time but is currently (July 2015) around 5%. The cost for supporting this
5% of users is dramatic. You should probably assume that JavaScript 5.1 is supported
by your users browser unless you have an un-proportional large amount of users
sitting with old browsers.</p>

<p>EcmaScript Edition 6 (ES6), also called Harmony was released in June 2015.
<a href='http://es6-features.org/'>es6-features.org</a> provides a
good summary of the new features. Implementation of Harmony is far from complete
in all browsers. These features must be used with care for some time to come.
You can use <a href='https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler'>Traceur</a> iframe
you want to start using ES6 already now.</p>

<p>Features for <a href='https://github.com/tc39/ecma262'>EcmaScript 7</a> were
listed already before EcmaScript 6 was apporved. One feature I'm looking forward
to is <code>Object.observe</code>. It will make data-binding a breeze.</p>
