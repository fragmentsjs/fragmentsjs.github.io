<h1>JavaScript (EcmaScript) versions</h1>

<p>JavaScript is a modern programming language that was misunderstood for many
years. <a href='crockford.com'>Douglas Crockford</a> wrote the article
<a href='http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html'>JavaScript:
The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language
</a> in 2011 reasoning around why he thinks this has been the case.</p>

<p>JavaScript 5.1 was a main update that was released in 2011 that enhanced
JavsScript in many ways. I'm using the added <code>Array</code> functions all
the time and getters/setters are used in the data binding implementation.
<code>Object.create</code> is used easily implement proper inheritance and
<code>Object.keys</code> makes it possible to list the properties of an object.
</p>

<p>It is safe to use most JavaScript 5.1 features if you're not concerned with
old browers like IE6/7/8. The combined market share for IE6/7/8 varies from time
to time but is currently (July 2015) around 5%. The cost for supporting this
5% of users is dramatic. You should probably assume that JavaScript 5.1 is supported
by your users browser unless you have an un-proportional large amount of users
sitting with old browsers.</p>

<p>EcmaScript Edition 6, also called Harmony was released in June 2015.
<a href='http://es6-features.org/'>es6-features.org</a> provides a
good summary of the new features. Implementation of Harmony is far from complete
in all browsers. These features must be used with care for some time to come.</p>

<p>Features for <a href='https://github.com/tc39/ecma262'>EcmaScript 7</a> were
listed already before EcmaScript 6 was apporved. One feature I'm looking forward
to is <code>Object.observe</code>. It will make data-binding a breeze.</p>
