    <h1>IndexedDb</h1>

    <p>The term "Mobile first" has become the accepted approach today. Luke Wroblevski was writing about this early on, check his
      <a href='http://www.lukew.com'>blog</a> for his writings. One of the main challenges when developing mobile apps is that the internet connection often isn't reliable. Local storage is therefore needed.</p>

    <p><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API'>IndexedDb</a> is emerging as the technology for local storage. Support isn't yet 100% (see below) but this is improving all the time. IndexedDb is a fairly comprehensive standard so it takes a little while to get used to. The examples below shows how it can be used and there is also a <code>Db</code> class that can re-used in your projects.</p>

    <p>IndexedDb fits well with the <code>fragmentsjs</code> data-bind technique.

      <ul>
        <li><a href='src/indexeddb/index.html'>Here</a> is an example</li>

        <li><a href='src/indexeddb/index-verbose.html'>This</a> example has extensive logging which makes it easy to see how IndexedDb works.</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>Compability/Alternative solutions</h2>
    <p>Support for IndexedDb is coming in all major
      <a href='http://caniuse.com/#search=indexeddb'>browsers</a> but iOS is known for being buggy and some features are currently (July 2015) missing in some browsers. There is an <a href='https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim'>IndexedDBShim</a> that can be used in browsers lacking full support. This shim uses WebSQL instead of IndexedDb when IndexedDb is missing. Make sure to read
      <a href='https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/issues/167'>this issue</a> before using the shim though.</p>

    <p><a href='https://dev.yathit.com/ydn-db/index.html'>YDN-DB</a> provides a nice wrapper around IndexedDB. It also uses the IndexedDBShim in cases where IndexedDb support is lacking.</p>

    <p><code>
<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage'>localStorage</a>
</code> and
      <code><a href='https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/UsingtheJavascriptDatabase/UsingtheJavascriptDatabase.html'>
WebSQL</a></code> are the other technologies used for offline storage. <code>localStorage</code> is a simple key/value store and is supported by almost all
      <a href='http://caniuse.com/#search=localstorage'>browsers</a>.

      <code>WebSQL</code> is supported by webKit/Blink (Safari, Chrome, Opera) but not by Gecko (FF) and Trident (IE), see
      <a href='http://caniuse.com/#feat=sql-storage'>caniuse</a> for the details.</p>
