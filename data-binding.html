<h1>Data binding</h1>

Data binding is a method for automatically reflecting changes in a object in the
gui. This reduces the amount of coding needed in many situations.

It is actually simpler that you might think to roll this on your own.
Here is an example where JavaScript setters are used. All the user has to do
is to add the extra attribute <pre>data-bind='property name'</pre> to the DOM elements
you need,  call <pre>createUIObject</pre> and voil√° an object with the specified properties
is created.

to show the developer console).
